        <p>
          I studied architecture in high school, then English Literature in college, and ended up in banking after college.
          My architecture influence trained me to create solutions that have both utility and aesthetic, this translates into sustainable and readable code.
          The literature background gives me the ability to write code that narrates with intention, not only describing it, but as well as how it should evolve.
